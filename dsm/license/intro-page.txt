Group Biography
---------------
The Distributed State Machine Toolkit was developed by the Policy Lifecycle Technologies 
group at IBM Research, as part of our partnership with the 
Army Research Lab (http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.htm)
and the 
International Technology Alliance (http://www.usukita.org/)
program.

The group is investigating platform-independent policy frameworks to specify, 
analyze, and deploy security and networking policies. The goal is to provide easy 
to use mechanisms for refining high-level user-specified goals into low-level controls.
